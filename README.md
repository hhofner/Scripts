# Scripts
## List of miscellaneous  scripts in various languages for various purposes

### TCP Tic-Tac-Toe
Files: 
  * TCPServer.py
  * TCPClient.py

Run these two files on 'localhost' and whatever port you may prefer
and see AI's play Tic Tac Toe.

### Ruby Secret Santa
File(s):
  * secret_santa.rb

Script to send out secret santa emails to participants. Keep in mind that
the secret santa pairings get deleted after they are sent, so the user of the script
has no idea who they are.

In the options dictionary, enter your email domain, username and password (for GMAIL
you will have to "unlock" some setting temporarily). 

Run the Ruby script, and it will ask for participants name and email.
